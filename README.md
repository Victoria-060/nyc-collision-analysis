# NYC-Collision-Analysis
Capstone data analytics project exploring NYC collision data: data cleaning, visualization and actionable road safety insights.

## Overview:

This project analyzes New York City motor vehicle collision data to uncover accident pattern, trends, risk factors, and high-risk locations. The dataset includes approximately 238,000 reported accidents across 17 vehicle types and 6,140 streets.

The dashboard was built in Power BI to explore accident distribution by time, location, vehicle type, and contributing factors. The goal is to:
- Identify the seasonal changes and high-risk time periods of these accidents
- Detect hotspots with high accident frequencies
- Understand leading causes of accidents
- Provide insights for traffic safety improvements

## Dataset:
  
- Source: NYC Vehicle Collision Data
- Records: 238,000 accidents
- Vehicle Types: 17 (passenger vehicles, taxis, bicycles, motorcycles, etc.)
- Geography: 6,140 streets in NYC
- Time Span: 2021 – 2023

## Dashboard Features
The Power BI dashboard highlights:

- KPIs:
  - Total Vehicles: 17
  - Total Streets: 6,140
  - Accidents Reported: 238K

- Visuals:
  - Percentage of Non-Fatal vs Fatal Accidents
  - Accidents by Vehicle Type
  - Accidents by Days of Week and Hour of Day
  - Accident Trends by Year & Month
  - Top 10 Streets with Most Accidents
  - Percentage of Accidents by Year
  - Top 5 Contributing Factors

- Filters:
  - Street
  - Vehicle Type
  - Fatal/Non-Fatal Accident
  - Persons Involved (Pedestrians, Motorists, Cyclists)
  - Day of the Week / Month / Year

## Analysis & Insights

### Q1: Compare the percentage (%) of total accidents by month. Do you notice any seasonal patterns?

From the trend chart (2021–2023), accident remains quite relatively stable throughout the year. A slight increase was shown around summer periods (May–July), likely related to higher travel activity. December shows a small dip, possibly due to reduced commuting and holiday seasonal effects. 

Generally, No extreme seasonal changes, but it is noticeable that accidents peak slightly in warmer months.

### Q2: Break down accident frequency by day of week and hour of day. When do accidents occur most frequently?

By Day of Week: Accidents occur most frequently on Fridays, followed by Thursdays and Wednesdays. Sundays record the lowest accident counts.

By Time of Day: Mornings show the highest accident volumes, followed closely by afternoons ansd evening respectively especially during commuting hours (3PM–7PM). Nights (after midnight) record the fewest accidents. The Friday morning rush hour is the riskiest period for accidents.

### Q3: On which particular street were the most accidents reported? What does that represent as a percentage (%) of all reported accidents?

Belt Parkway had the highest number of reported accidents: 3.7K cases. As a percentage of all accidents (238K total):
(3,700 / 238,000) × 100 ≈ 1.55%
This means Belt Parkway alone accounts for approximately 1.6% of all reported accidents in the dataset.

### Q4: What was the most common contributing factor for the accidents reported in this sample (based on Vehicle 1)? What about fatal accidents specifically?

Most Common Overall Factor:
Driver Inattention/Distraction = 58.3K accidents. This ties closely with “Unspecified” factors also 58.3K and Failure to Yield, following closely behind with 16.6K.

Fatal Accidents:
While not explicitly broken down in the dashboard, research and patterns suggest Driver Inattention and Failure to Yield Right of Way are leading causes of fatal collisions as well. These factors typically contribute disproportionately to severe outcomes.

## Tools & Technologies

- Power BI → Dashboard development & visualization
- Power Query / Excel → Data cleaning & transformation

## Deliverables

- Power BI dashboard (NYC_Collision_Dashboard.pbix)
- Documentation (Report)
- Insights & recommendations

## Conclusion and Recommendation

This analysis highlights trends and risk factors in NYC traffic collisions, supporting the need for continued safety initiatives. These insights can guide policymakers, traffic authorities in implementing targeted safety measures such as awareness campaigns to help the public better understand and mitigate road safety risks, stricter enforcements in high risk locations and interventins during peak times.
